How Does CONFLUX Work?
======================

The CONFLUX (Calculation Of Neutrino FLUX) software framework is built with the goal of simplifying and standardizing neutrino flux calculations. CONFLUX is packaged with three prediction modes:

- Summation mode
- :math:`\beta` Conversion mode
- Direct Experimental Measurement mode

All of which calculate the Neutrino spectrum in different ways. A block diagram of how the calculation is run is provided below.
