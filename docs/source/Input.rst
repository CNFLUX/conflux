Executable and Examples***********************Running the executable=======================CONFLUX is packaged with an executable ``quickflux.py``  to perform simple calculations, such as neutrino flux from an low enrichment uranium (LEU) reactor at equilibrium state. The executable is capable of taking a JSON file as the input. The output is a csv file that contains the spectrum energy, amplitude and uncertainty. Currently, the neutrino calculation does not calculate time dependent reactor model. The user can run the calculation through:.. code-block:: bash    python3 exec/quickflux.py input.json     Here is the example of the Highlighted examples====================CONFLUX contains a series of example for common reactor neutrino calculations that are more complicated than ``quickflux.py`` can do. The applications includes:- Time dependent reactor neutrino evolution as the fission fractions change over long LEU reactor cycles.- Individual beta/neutrino spectrum calculation with non-zero neutrino mass.- Reactor- Combination of the conversion and summation calculation results.- Neutrino flux change over time after a burst fission.
